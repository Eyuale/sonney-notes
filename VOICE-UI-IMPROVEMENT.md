# ✅ Voice UI Improvement - Chat Messages

## 🎉 UI Enhancement Implemented

**Improvement**: Voice transcribed text now displays as proper chat messages instead of just in the input box.

**Result**: More natural and expressive conversation flow!

---

## 🔧 Changes Applied

### 1. ✅ Voice Text as Chat Messages
**Before (input box only):**
```typescript
onTranscript: (text) => {
  setInput(text); // ❌ Only shows in input box
  // WebSocket handles the sending automatically
},
```

**After (proper chat messages):**
```typescript
onTranscript: (text) => {
  // Display the transcribed voice text as a user message
  setMessages((m) => [
    ...m,
    { id: crypto.randomUUID(), role: "user" as const, content: text },
  ]);
  // Clear the input field since we're showing it as a message
  setInput("");
},
```

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Message Flow
**Voice message flow now:**
1. **User speaks** → Voice recognition
2. **Text transcribed** → Displayed as user chat message
3. **AI processes** → Shows processing indicator
4. **AI responds** → Displayed as assistant chat message
5. **TTS plays** → User hears the response

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### 1. ✅ Natural Conversation Flow
**Before:**
```
[Input Box: "What is gravity?"]
[AI Response: "Gravity is the force..."]

```
