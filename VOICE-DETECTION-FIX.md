# Voice Detection Prevention & Continuous Mode Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. AI Detecting Its Own Voice
**Problem**: The AI was hearing and responding to its own TTS output, creating a feedback loop.

**Solution**: Enhanced speech recognition stopping during TTS:
- Stop speech recognition immediately when TTS starts
- Stop VAD (Voice Activity Detection) to prevent audio analysis
- Clear any pending silence timeouts
- Add proper logging to track the stopping process

### 2. Continuous Mode Not Working After First Response
**Problem**: After the first AI response, the microphone would stop working even when clicked.

**Solution**: Improved continuous mode restart logic:
- Always recreate speech recognition instead of trying to restart existing instances
- Increased delay to 3 seconds to prevent immediate feedback
- Simplified restart logic to avoid state conflicts
- Added proper error handling and retry mechanisms

## Key Changes Made

### Enhanced TTS Prevention
```typescript
// Stop speech recognition to prevent feedback loop
if (recognitionRef.current) {
  try {
    console.log('ðŸ›‘ Stopping speech recognition to prevent AI voice detection');
    recognitionRef.current.stop();
    setIsListening(false);
    setVoiceState("speaking");
    console.log('âœ… Speech recognition stopped successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('ðŸŽ¤ Speech recognition already stopped or error:', error);
  }
}

// Also stop VAD to prevent any audio analysis during TTS
if (animationFrameRef.current) {
  cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameRef.current);
  animationFrameRef.current = null;
  console.log('ðŸ›‘ VAD stopped to prevent AI voice detection');
}

// Clear any pending silence timeout
if (silenceTimeoutRef.current) {
  clearTimeout(silenceTimeoutRef.current);
  silenceTimeoutRef.current = null;
  console.log('ðŸ›‘ Silence timeout cleared');
}
```

### Improved Continuous Mode Restart
```typescript
// Restart speech recognition after TTS completes
if (continuousMode) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('ðŸ”„ Restarting speech recognition after TTS completion...');
    try {
      // Always recreate recognition to ensure clean state
      console.log('ðŸ”„ Recreating speech recognition for continuous mode...');
      startRecordingBrowser();
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('ðŸŽ¤ Speech recognition restart failed:', error);
      // Try to restart the entire recording process
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('ðŸ”„ Retrying speech recognition restart...');
        startRecordingBrowser();
      }, 1000);
    }
  }, 3000); // 3 second delay to prevent immediate feedback
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Voice Input**: User speaks, speech recognition captures it
2. **Processing**: After 1.5s silence, transcript is sent to AI
3. **TTS Prevention**: Speech recognition and VAD are completely stopped
4. **AI Response**: AI responds with text and voice
5. **Clean Restart**: After 3s delay, speech recognition is recreated fresh
6. **Continuous**: Process repeats seamlessly

## Testing

The system should now:
- âœ… Not detect AI's own voice during TTS
- âœ… Continue working after first AI response
- âœ… Allow continuous voice conversations
- âœ… Show proper status indicators
- âœ… Handle errors gracefully

## Console Logs to Watch

- `ðŸ›‘ Stopping speech recognition to prevent AI voice detection`
- `âœ… Speech recognition stopped successfully`
- `ðŸ›‘ VAD stopped to prevent AI voice detection`
- `ðŸ”„ Recreating speech recognition for continuous mode...`
- `ðŸŽ¤ Speech recognition restarted after TTS`

These logs confirm the fixes are working properly.
