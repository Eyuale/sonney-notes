## 🎯 What Browser Are You Using?

### ✅ Chrome or Edge:
**Should work!** Follow fixes above.

### ❌ Firefox:
**Won't work!** Firefox doesn't support Web Speech API.

**Options:**
1. **Switch to Chrome** (recommended, free)
2. **Add OpenAI API key** (paid, $0.006/min)

### ⚠️ Safari:
**Might work, might not.** Try Chrome if issues.

## 🚀 Paid Alternative (If Free Won't Work)

If the free browser API isn't working, use OpenAI Whisper:

### Quick Setup (3 minutes):

**1. Get OpenAI API Key:**
```
https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
Click "Create new secret key"
Copy the key (starts with sk-)
```

**2. Add to `.env.local` file:**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
```

**3. Edit `components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx`:**

Find this line (around line 46):
```tsx
const { ... } = useVoiceChat({
```

Change to:
```tsx
const { ... } = useVoiceChat({
  useBrowserSpeechAPI: false, // Use paid Whisper
```

**4. Restart server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Cost:** $0.006 per minute (very cheap!)
