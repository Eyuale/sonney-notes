# ✅ Voice Chat Error Fixed

## 🐛 Error Fixed

**Error**: `Cannot access 'speakResponse' before initialization`

**Root Cause**: Circular dependency in `useVoiceChatWS` hook where `speakResponse` was being used in `sendVoiceMessage` before it was defined.

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Problem:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG ORDER - speakResponse used before definition
const sendVoiceMessage = useCallback(async (message: string) => {
  // ... code ...
  speakResponse(data.content); // ❌ Used before definition
}, [options, speakResponse]); // ❌ Dependency on undefined function

const speakResponse = useCallback(async (text: string) => {
  // ... TTS implementation ...
}, []);
```

### Solution:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT ORDER - speakResponse defined first
const speakResponse = useCallback(async (text: string) => {
  // ... TTS implementation ...
}, []);

const sendVoiceMessage = useCallback(async (message: string) => {
  // ... code ...
  speakResponse(data.content); // ✅ Now defined
}, [options, speakResponse]); // ✅ Valid dependency
```

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Function Order
- **Moved `speakResponse`** before `sendVoiceMessage`
- **Eliminated circular dependency**
- **Proper dependency chain**

### 2. ✅ Dependency Resolution
- **`speakResponse`** is now defined when `sendVoiceMessage` needs it
- **`useCallback` dependencies** are properly resolved
- **No more initialization errors**

### 3. ✅ Code Structure
- **Logical order** - TTS function before message sending
- **Clean dependencies** - Each function depends on previously defined ones
- **No circular references**

## 🧪 Test the Fixed Voice Chat

### Quick Test:

1. **Click** the 🎤 microphone button
2. **Watch for**: "🔌 Connecting to voice chat..." (brief)
3. **See**: "🎤 Continuous listening... Speak anytime"
4. **Say**: "What is gravity?"
5. **Watch for**: "⚡ Processing audio... (real-time)"
6. **Get**: Fast response (1-2 seconds)
7. **Hear**: TTS response
8. **Continue**: Microphone stays active

### Teaching Commands:

- "Teach me about photosynthesis"
