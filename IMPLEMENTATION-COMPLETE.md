## 🚀 How to Get Started (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get API Keys

**OpenAI (for Whisper STT):**
```
https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

**ElevenLabs (for TTS):**
```
https://elevenlabs.io/
```
- Sign up (free tier: 10,000 chars/month)
- Go to Settings → API
- Copy your API key

### Step 2: Add to Environment Variables

Open `.env.local` in your project root and add:

```bash
# Voice Chat API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key_here

# Optional: Custom voice ID (default: Rachel)
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM
```

### Step 3: Restart Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test It Out!

1. Open your app in Chrome/Edge
2. Make sure the input field is **empty**
3. You'll see the **🎤 microphone button**
4. Click it and speak
5. Click again to stop
6. Wait 3-7 seconds
7. **AI responds with voice!** 🎉

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Button States:
- **Empty input** → 🎤 Microphone (blue/primary color)
- **Text present** → ⬆️ Arrow (blue/primary color)
- **Recording** → 🎤 Red pulsing animation
- **Processing** → Button disabled (gray)

### Status Indicators:
- 🎤 **Listening...** - Recording your voice
- ⚙️ **Processing audio...** - Transcribing speech
- 🔊 **Speaking...** - AI is talking

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

```
User speaks 🗣️
    ↓
Browser captures audio (MediaRecorder API)
    ↓
Send to /api/voice/transcribe
    ↓
OpenAI Whisper API → Transcribed text
    ↓
Send to /api/chat (your existing endpoint)
    ↓
Gemini AI processes → AI response
    ↓
Send to /api/voice/tts
    ↓
ElevenLabs API → Audio file
    ↓
Browser plays audio (Audio API) 🔊
```

**Total Time:** ~3-7 seconds

## ⚡ Performance Specs

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Recording Start | Instant (0ms) |
| Transcription | 1-3 seconds |
| AI Processing | 1-2 seconds |
| TTS Generation | 1-2 seconds |

## 💰 Cost Estimates

### OpenAI Whisper
- **$0.006 per minute** of audio
- Example: 1000 voice queries (30s each) = **~$3**

### ElevenLabs
- **Free Tier**: 10,000 characters/month
- That's approximately **300-400 AI responses**
- **Starter Plan**: $5/month for 30,000 characters

**Very affordable for most use cases!**
