# Voice and Text Synchronization Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Voice and Text Not Synchronized
**Problem**: The voice and text weren't appearing simultaneously, causing a disconnect between what the user sees and hears.

**Solution**: 
- Display complete text immediately when AI responds
- Use faster progress tracking (50ms intervals instead of 100ms)
- Reduced audio loading timeout to 3 seconds for faster response
- Added early resolution when audio can play (readyState >= 3)

### 2. Voice Playing After Speech Recognition Restarts
**Problem**: The voice was playing after the speech recognition had already restarted, causing timing issues.

**Solution**:
- Reduced all restart delays from 2-3 seconds to 1 second
- Faster audio loading and playback
- Better progress tracking for synchronization

## Key Changes Made

### Faster Progress Tracking
```typescript
// Start progress tracking when audio starts playing
audio.onplay = () => {
  console.log('ðŸ”Š Audio playback started');
  isPlaying = true;
  
  // Clear any existing interval
  if (progressInterval) {
    clearInterval(progressInterval);
  }
  
  // Start progress tracking immediately
  progressInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (audio.duration > 0 && isPlaying && !audio.paused) {
      const progress = (audio.currentTime / audio.duration) * 100;
      onProgress?.(progress);
    }
  }, 50); // Faster updates for better synchronization
};
```

### Immediate Text Display
```typescript
// Display the complete response text immediately
options.onResponse?.(responseText);

// Start TTS with synchronized text display
const ttsPromise = speakResponseInternal(responseText, (progress) => {
  // Calculate how many words should be visible based on TTS progress
  const words = responseText.split(' ');
  const targetWordIndex = Math.floor((progress / 100) * words.length);
  
  // Update text to match TTS progress - show progressively more text
  if (targetWordIndex > 0) {
    const currentText = words.slice(0, targetWordIndex).join(' ');
    options.onResponse?.(currentText);
  }
});
```

### Faster Audio Loading
```typescript
audio.oncanplay = () => {
  console.log('ðŸ”Š Audio can play', {
    duration: audio.duration,
    readyState: audio.readyState
  });
  // Try to resolve early if we can play
  if (!resolved && audio.readyState >= 3) { // HAVE_FUTURE_DATA
    console.log('ðŸ”Š Audio can play, resolving early');
    cleanup();
    resolve();
  }
};

// Set a shorter timeout and try to play anyway
setTimeout(() => {
  if (!resolved) {
    console.log('ðŸ”Š Audio loading timeout, attempting to play anyway...');
    if (audio.readyState >= 2) { // HAVE_CURRENT_DATA
      console.log('ðŸ”Š Audio has data, proceeding with playback');
      cleanup();
      resolve();
    } else {
      console.error('Audio loading timeout after 3 seconds');
      cleanup();
      reject(new Error('Audio loading timeout'));
    }
  }
}, 3000); // Reduced timeout to 3 seconds for faster response
```

### Reduced Restart Delays
```typescript
// Restart speech recognition after TTS completes
if (continuousMode) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('ðŸ”„ Restarting speech recognition after TTS completion...');
    try {
      // Always recreate recognition to ensure clean state
      console.log('ðŸ”„ Recreating speech recognition for continuous mode...');
      startRecordingBrowser();
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('ðŸŽ¤ Speech recognition restart failed:', error);
      // Try to restart the entire recording process
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('ðŸ”„ Retrying speech recognition restart...');
        startRecordingBrowser();
      }, 1000);
    }
  }, 1000); // Reduced delay to 1 second for faster restart
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **AI Response**: Text appears immediately on screen
2. **TTS Start**: Voice starts playing simultaneously
3. **Progress Sync**: Text updates progressively with voice (optional)
4. **Fast Restart**: Speech recognition restarts after 1 second
5. **Continuous**: Process repeats seamlessly

## Testing

The system should now:
- âœ… **Show text immediately** when AI responds
- âœ… **Play voice simultaneously** with text display
- âœ… **Restart speech recognition quickly** (1 second delay)
- âœ… **Maintain synchronization** between voice and text
- âœ… **Work continuously** without timing issues

## Console Logs to Watch

- `ðŸ”Š Audio ready, starting playback`
- `ðŸ”Š Audio playback started`
- `ðŸ”„ Restarting speech recognition after TTS completion...`
- `ðŸ”„ Recreating speech recognition for continuous mode...`

These logs confirm the synchronization fixes are working properly.
