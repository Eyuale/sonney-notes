## 🎯 Usage Instructions

### Voice Input (FREE):
1. Click 🎤 microphone button
2. Speak your question
3. **Browser transcribes locally (FREE!)**
4. AI responds with voice

### What You'll Notice:
- ⚡ **Faster transcription** - No network delay
- 🔒 **More private** - Audio never uploaded
- 💰 **Zero cost** - Use unlimited!

## 🔄 Fallback Option (Optional)

If you want the most accurate transcription (paid), you can still use OpenAI Whisper:

```tsx
// In components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx
const { ... } = useVoiceChat({
  useBrowserSpeechAPI: false, // Use paid API instead
  onTranscript: (text) => { ... },
});
```

Then add to `.env.local`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
```

**But we recommend the free browser API - it works great!**
